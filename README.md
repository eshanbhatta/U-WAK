# U-WAK
## Inspiration
My Grandfather faces a few issues when it comes to walking with a stick. He is very fragile and does not have the ability to walk with a stick while balancing himself and has suffered severe injuries due to the same cause. So i wanted to do something which would allow him to walk without loosing balance,which occurs when you lift the stick

## What it does
Its a stick which doesn't  need to be lifted when walking.Thus the chances of falling decreases

## How we built it
We considered various challenges faced by the aged and the we carefully designed it to their comfort.
We  then used an Arduino Uno along with motor driver in order to facilitate the movements of the motor  and carefully judged its speed . At the end we added a few switches and end and used a toggle switch for control of movements

## Challenges we ran into
We tried installing a Bluetooth and infrared censor but we were cut short of time and materials for it .We couldn't support 2 motor drivers due to the shortage of supplies.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are quiet proud of its design and the fact that we manged to finish this despite the shortage of materials and time.

## What we learned
We learnt to better manage our time and work under pressure

## What's next for U-WAK
We plan to add Bluetooth,self stabilization as a feature and infrared sense,location tracker,fitness tracker to it as a premium edition.We hope this reaches the masses and many people wont suffer from the lack of proper physical support
